# Predicting Amazon Stock Prices Using Advanced Time Series Models: A Comparative Study of LSTM, GRU, and Prophet Through Model Optimisation

## Dataset
My dataset is for Amazon stock prices. I have included a csv file upload to the repository but the data can me accessed directly through the Google Finance extension on Google Colab. This project only uses the 'Date' and 'Close'columns. 

The other columns include: 
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Adj Close
- Volume

The unused columns could be utilised for further research.

## Description
The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance of LSTM, GRU, and Prophet models in predicting Amazon's stock prices using historical data directly from Yahoo Finance. The aim was to optimize these models through hyperparameter tuning to identify the most accurate and reliable approach for forecasting future Amazon stock prices. I chose LSTM, GRU, and Prophet because they are advanced time series models commonly used for predicting future values based on historical data, particularly in financial applications like stock price forecasting

## Challenges
I lacked the computing power to input all of the code files in one big Google Colab. I had no choice but to program the models separately, however it would be beneficial to do this in further research so that I could compare the models directly.  

## Target Audience
This project is primarily intended for individuals and organizations in the learning about the financial industry, as well as stock help future investors seeking to make informed decisions based on theoretically accurate stock price predictions (not currently as the licence won't allow that). 

## Technologies and Dependencies
Programming Language: Python
Framework: TensorFlow
Tools: Google Colab
Install: pip install yfinance
Imports: all imports in the relevant code files

## Contributions
Contributions to expand the project are welcome once they are verified.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Add your contributions (code or documentation)
4. Commit and push
5. Wait for pull request to be merged

## Licence for data
Yahoo Finance has a general non commercial use licence so we can use it as much as needed just not for commercial purposes.
